# My .dotfiles
A collection of all my dotfiles, managed with stow.

Thanks to Jake Wiesler's [blog post](https://www.jakewiesler.com/blog/managing-dotfiles) I manage all my dotfiles using [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)! If you are looking for new ways to manage your dotfiles, I would definately encourage you to check out that blog post. You can also look into [dotdrop](https://github.com/deadc0de6/dotdrop#getting-started) and [GitHub's dotfiles website](https://dotfiles.github.io/) for even more tutorials and tools.
